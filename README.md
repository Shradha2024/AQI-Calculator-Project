# AQI Calculator Project

This project is a Machine Learning-based Air Quality Index (AQI) prediction tool built using Python on Google Colab.  
It uses real-world air pollution data from CPCB to analyze and visualize AQI trends.

# Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Google Colab

# Features
- Calculates AQI from PM2.5 and PM10 pollutant values
- Cleans and preprocesses raw data
- Visualizes AQI trends with graphs
- Trains a simple ML model to predict AQI levels

# Dataset Source
- CPCB datasets (publicly available or via Kaggle)

# About
This project was developed as part of my AI/ML learning journey and demonstrates basic skills in:
- Data handling
- Visualization
- AQI analysis
- Supervised ML model building
